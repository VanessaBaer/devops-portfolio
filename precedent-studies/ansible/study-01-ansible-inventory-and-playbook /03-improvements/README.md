# 03 — Improvements

This folder contains the refactored playbook with enhancements.

## Improvements
- Variables (`vars.yaml`) for package/service.
- Conditional support for multiple OS families.
- Encrypted private key with Ansible Vault.
- Handlers for service restart.

## Why it matters
These changes make the playbook:
- More portable
- More secure
- Easier to maintain in production

⚠️ **Note:** Like earlier stages, these improvements are for **learning purposes** only. Applying them requires a real Ansible lab setup.
